<p>Earlier this year, an ex-<a href="http://www.gadgetsnow.com/brands/Apple">Apple</a>&nbsp;employee claimed how the company had tried to stop her from talking in detail about the circumstances she left the company. It was reported that a group of state treasurers called upon the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate Apple and see if it was blocking employees from talking openly. Now, Apple has released a note — titled — “Our Commitment to an Open and Collaborative Workplace” — where it has detailed new policies for employees. Apple has said that all employees have the freedom to speak openly about any issues they face at work.</p>

<p>“Apple’s Board intends to remain engaged in the company’s efforts to foster a culture where everybody belongs, and a workplace where everyone is treated with dignity and respect,” said the company in the note.<br><strong><br>Employees can talk freely about harassment, discrimination</strong><br>In the note, Apple said that employees “are permitted to speak freely about your wages, hours, and working conditions, including information about harassment, discrimination, or any other conduct you have reason to believe is unlawful, and nothing in this Policy, or any Apple policy, should be interpreted as being restrictive of your right to do so.”</p>

<p>NDAs — or non-disclosure agreements — are something that most big tech companies get their employees to sign. Apple is also one of them. The company has clarified its stance on certain NDA policies as well. Apple said that it does use confidentiality provisions to protect corporate information, such as operational, financial, trade secrets, and other business information. Further, it said that it also uses non-disparagement clauses in the limited instances when we enter into mutually agreed separation agreements with employees, in compliance with laws. However, Apple further noted that “Consistent with Apple’s global policy, such provisions are not intended to restrict an employee’s or independent contractor’s ability to speak freely about harassment, discrimination, or conduct they believe to be unlawful.”</p>
